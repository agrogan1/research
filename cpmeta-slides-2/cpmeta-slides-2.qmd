## Introduction

* Whether spanking is helpful or harmful to children continues to be the source of considerable debate among both researchers and the public. 
* This article addresses 2 persistent issues, namely whether effect sizes for spanking are distinct from those for physical abuse, and whether effect sizes for spanking are robust to study design differences.

## Analysis

Meta-analyses focused specifically on spanking were conducted on a total of 111 unique effect sizes representing 160,927 children.

## What Is An Effect Size? {.smaller}

In meta-analysis, an effect size is an attempt to make comparable different measures on different numeric scales. Effect sizes are often expressed in terms of standard deviations.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-height: 3

N <- 30 

x1 <- rnorm(N, 0, 1)

x2 <- rnorm(N, .25, 1)

x <- c(x1, x2)

group <- rep(c(1,2), each = N)

# group <- factor(group)

mydata <- data.frame(x, group)

plot_ly(mydata, 
        x = ~x, 
        type = "histogram",
        # y = ~group,
        text = ~group,
        color = ~factor(group),
        symbol = ~factor(group),
        marker = list(size = 10)) %>% 
  layout(title = '2 Groups That Differ By .25 Standard Deviations',
         xaxis = list(title = 'Some Measure X'))

```

> "... in order to have one more favorable outcome in the "treatment" group compared to the "control" group, we need to treat 13.0 people on average." [https://rpsychologist.com/cohend/](https://rpsychologist.com/cohend/)

## Results

* Thirteen of 17 mean effect sizes were significantly different from zero and all indicated a link between spanking and increased risk for detrimental child outcomes. 
* Effect sizes did not substantially differ between spanking and physical abuse or by study design characteristics.
