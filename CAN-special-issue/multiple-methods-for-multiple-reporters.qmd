# Background

The Lehigh Study presents a unique opportunity. Data are collected on experiences of abusive discipline as reported by *administrative* reports, two *parental* reports at two different time points, and two *self* reports at two different time points. However, in the absence of a gold standard measure of abusive discipline, appropriately aggregating these multiple reports across multiple time points represents an analytic challenge.

In the manuscript below, we employ multiple strategies to estimate the relationship of these multiple reports from multiple reporters at multiple time points to a mental health outcome. We compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of these different methods, and conclude the manuscript with suggestions on optimal methodological approaches to confront the methodological challenges that are posed by having multiple reports from multiple reporters at multiple time points. 

# Basic Conceptual Model

We begin with a basic conceptual model of the reports and time points in the data, without at this point suggesting any associational or causal relationships.

# Variable Abbreviations

For parsimony, we use the following conventions for variable names.

| Variable          | Label                               |
|-------------------|:------------------------------------|
| `administrative`  | administrative report               |
| `PR1`             | parental report in early childhood  |
| `PR2`             | parental report in middle childhood |
| `SR1`             | adolescent self report              |
| `SR2`             | adult self report                   |
| `covariates`      | covariates (multiple variables)     |
| `outcome`         | mental health outcome               |

# Methods

## OLS (or Logistic) Regression

### Diagram

![OLS](Slide2.png){#fig-OLS}

### Equation

$$\text{outcome} = \beta_0 + \beta \text{P1} + \beta \text{P2} + \beta \text{SR1} + \beta \text{SR2} + \beta \text{administrative} + \Sigma \beta \text{covariates} + e_i$$ {#eq-OLS}

### Syntax

`regress outcome P1 P2 SR1 SR2 administrative covariates`

## Summing Across Reporters

### Diagram

![summing across reporters](Slide3.png){#fig-sum}

### Equation

First, we average parental reports:

$$P = \frac{P1 + P2}{2}$$ {#eq-average-parental}

Then, we average self reports: 

$$SR = \frac{SR1 + SR2}{2}$$ {#eq-average-self}

Lastly, we estimate an OLS model in which averaged parental and self reports are variables in the model. 

$$\text{outcome} = \beta_0 + \beta \text{P} + \beta \text{SR} + \beta \text{administrative} + \Sigma \beta \text{covariates} + e_i$$ {#eq-average-reporters}

### Syntax

`regress outcome P SR administrative covariates`

### Equation

$$\begin{matrix}
& \text{P1} & \text{P2} & \text{SR1} & \text{SR2} & \text{administrative} & \text{outcome} \\
\text{P1} & 1 & r_{\text{P1, P2}} & r_{\text{P1, SR1}} & r_{\text{P1, SR2}} & r_{\text{P1, administrative}} & r_{\text{P1, outcome}} \\ 
\text{P2} & & 1 & r_{\text{P2, SR1}} & r_{\text{P2, SR2}} & r_{\text{P2, administrative}} & r_{\text{P2, outcome}}\\
\text{SR1} & & & 1 & r_{\text{SR1, SR2}} & r_{\text{SR1, administrative}} & r_{\text{SR1, outcome}}\\
\text{SR2} & & & & 1 & r_{\text{SR2, administrative}} & r_{\text{SR2, outcome}}\\
\text{administrative} & & & & & 1 & r_{\text{administrative, outcome}}\\ \\
