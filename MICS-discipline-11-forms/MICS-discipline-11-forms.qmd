## Objective 

To test associations between 11 parental discipline behaviors and child aggression, distraction, and prosocial peer relations across low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

## Study Design {.smaller}

Data came from the fourth (2009-2013) and fifth (2012-2017) rounds of the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS). Survey responses publicly available as of July 2020 were included. Data were restricted to household respondents with focal children under 5 years. The final analytic sample included 163,345 respondents across 60 LMICs. Data were analyzed using Bayesian multilevel logistic regression.

```{r}

library(leaflet)

leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.TonerLite) %>%
  addPolygons(data = MICS, 
              fillOpacity = .5, 
              color = "#5b92e5", 
              # label = MICS$NAME
              )

```

Main Effects
:::

Verbal reasoning (80%) and shouting (66%) were the most common parental discipline behaviors toward young children. Psychological and physical aggression were associated with higher child aggression and distraction. Verbal reasoning was associated with lower aggression (OR = 0.92, 95% CI \[0.86, 0.99\]) and higher prosocial peer relations (OR = 1.30, 95% CI \[1.20, 1.42\]).

Taking away privileges was associated with higher distraction (OR = 1.09, 95% CI \[1.03, 1.15\] and lower prosocial peer relations (OR = 0.92, 95% CI \[0.87, 0.98\]). Giving the child something else to do was associated with higher distraction (OR = 1.06, 95% CI \[1.01, 1.12\].

Random Slopes
:::

Random slopes suggested statistically credible cultural variation in the associations between parenting behaviors and child socio-emotional outcomes.

## Conclusions

::: {.fragment .highlight-current-red}
Psychological and physical aggression were disadvantageous for children's socio-emotional development across countries. 
:::
::: {.fragment .highlight-current-green}
Only verbal reasoning was associated with positive child socio-emotional development. 
:::
::: {.fragment .highlight-blue}
Greater emphasis should be dedicated to reducing parental use of psychological and physical aggression across cultural contexts.
