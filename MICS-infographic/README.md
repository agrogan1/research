# MICS Infographic

Experimenting with RMarkdown, Quarto and PowerPoint to create an infographic of our MICS studies.

The PowerPoint file is likely the best version of the infographic due to PowerPoint's flexibility in formatting and layout [[Direct Download Link](https://github.com/agrogan1/research/raw/master/MICS-infographic/MICS-infographic.pptx)]. This is the version as updated by Professor Shawna Lee.

[HTML](https://agrogan1.github.io/research/MICS-infographic/MICS-infographic.html) and [PDF](https://agrogan1.github.io/research/MICS-infographic/MICS-infographic.pdf) versions may also be useful, and also now contain updated text.
